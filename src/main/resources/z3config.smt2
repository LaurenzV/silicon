; ATTENTION: Continuing multi-line statements must be indented with at least
;            one tab or two spaces. All other lines must not start with tabs
;            or more than one space.

; Currently, print-success MUST come first, because it guarantees that every query to Z3, including
; setting options, is answered by a success (or error) reply from Z3. Silicon currently relies on
; these replies when it interacts with Z3 via stdio.
